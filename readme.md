# Standar & Sazón

The standardization and costing of recipes is a process that allows obtaining the real value of the dishes before and after taxes for their subsequent sale, as well as creating a standard for the use of raw materials and assembly of dishes within the kitchen.

Standar & sazón seeks to facilitate the recipe creation process, reduce preparation time, and speed up the collection of essential data such as prices, product performance, expenses, among others.
